# Building_a_Spam_Filter_with_Naive_Bayes
In this project, we built a spam filter for SMS messages using the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. Our goal was to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% and expected that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or ham (non-spam).
